# PersonalBudgetSavings
personalBudgetAndSavings App

17.06.18

This project is my personal way to learn swift and osx programming in some practical way. I have read maybe 5 different books on 
osx programming
but realized, when my friend asked me to make him a simple loan calculator, that I cant program anything...
Then I decided to just make up an interesting project and start banging my head against the wall :) with a fairly simple yet kind of 
"you have to know the basics"
project.

Creating a personal budgeting tool for mac. The app is going to have two main functionalities.
1. plan a budget, (ideally a positive one :)
2. to make a savings plan, first of all to calculate how many percents of your net salary you want to save / invest.
then to plan the saving time and visualize the outcome graphically.
the idea is that user could input things like 
- saving time
- interest
- possibility to change monthly saving amount along the way, or stop all together, AND see the effects graphically.

I have no idea how to know if somebody ever reads this or looks at this project =) Im also trying to learn version control with this project.
I think its very important and very under appreciated ( at least in my school it was)

Any comment / feedback is welcome
